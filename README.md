# Week 1 In-class projects


## Project 1: Build a responsive cookie store web page

0. Link the `css/styles.css` file in the index.html `<head>` section.
    - _We will use this to add our own custom styles._
1. Add Bootstrap
    - Use the [CDN link tag](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/#quick-start)
2. Apply the [bootstrap grid classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/)
    - The 4 cookie products should appear side by side in one row on large screens
    - The 4 cookies should appear one per row on smaller screens
    - ![grid](screenshots/cookie-store-grid.png)
3. Apply styling to make the page responsive as follows:
    - On larger screens:
    - ![larger screens](screenshots/cookie-store-large-screen.png)
    - On smaller screens:
    - ![smaller screens](screenshots/cookie-store-mobile-screen.png)
4. Using only bootstrap styles, and not moving any html tags, make the cookie products alternate as follows on larger screens:
    - ![larger screens](screenshots/cookie-store-large-screen-alt.png)
    - _Hint:_ You can wrap your existing HTML in extra `<div>` tags
    - _Hint:_ Look into the [reordering classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/#reordering)
    - *Clarifications*
        + _Don't_ change the order of the 3 main cookie html tags, the `<h3>`, followed by the `<p>`, and then the `<img>` tags. _Remember, we want to keep semantic order._
        + You can add `<div>`'s and bootstrap classes as needed, you can wrap any tags in divs as needed, as long as you don't change the order.
5. **Stretch** Add a custom google font to our page:
    - Select and link a font from: https://fonts.google.com/
    - Add the font style to select tags
