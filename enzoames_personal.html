    <h5 class="body-style"">I recommend everyone to invest in cryptocurrencies and upcoming ICOs. Its a growing market and the use of block-chain technology will have a great impact on our daily routine in the coming years. Step one for a biginer is to research and understand the blockchain. one can begin by looking into Bitcoin and Ethereum. These will open the doors to you about different currecies/tokens out there that have great potential. Just imagine a decentralized world where we eliminate the middle-man (banks) and absurd fees.</h5>
